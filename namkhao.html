        <h2>Laos:<br>Nam Khao (Crispy Rice Salad)</h2>

        <p>With bordering homelands, Lao cuisine can best be described as Thai food's bolder cousin — spicier, herbaceous, and much less sweet.
        </p>

        <p>However, if you find yourself amongst New York City's<a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/files/reports/osdc/pdf/nyc-restaurant-industry-final.pdf">estimated 23,650 restaurants,</a> good luck finding a Lao restaurant — because there are none. Rather, you can catch glimpses of Laos hidden on some Thai menus, or might be able to request your Thai order "Lao-style."
        </p>

        <p>There's a reason why Lao food isn't more visible; Thai food's dominance throughout the city didn't occur accidentally. In 2002 Thailand's government launched a<a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/why-are-there-so-many-thai-restaurants-7104115#:~:text=In%202002%2C%20the%20Thai%20government,wanted%20to%20open%20restaurants%20abroad.">gastro-diplomatic initiative</a>to spread its cuisine globally, even sponsoring its citizens to open restaurants abroad.</p>

        <p>For 23-year-old Ashley Sayarath, growing up Lao in Los Angeles meant experiencing a push-and-pull of cultural identities. Despite Southern California's large Asian population, her neighborhood was predominantly Hispanic and Black, giving her minimal access to Asian food outside of her mom's cooking.</p>
            
        <p>"As I was growing up and my mom was making these Lao dishes, it was really hard for me to just be like, 'Okay, I'm just going to eat it,'" Ashley said. "I was like, 'Girl, what's happening here?'"</p>
            
        <p>It wasn't until moving to New York as an adult that Ashley began to appreciate her Lao background, especially through food.</p>
            
        <p>"When people would ask me things about myself, I really couldn't answer to the fullest potential. So I was basically relearning my heritage and relearning these cuisines," she said.</p>
            
        <p>One dish that Ashley recommends as an introduction to Lao food is Nam Khao, sharing that the crispy rice salad is a great way to become acquainted with the basic flavors and textures of Lao cuisine. The dish combines deep-fried rice balls with fermented Lao pork sausage (som moo), fresh herbs, lime, fish sauce, and chili, eaten with fresh vegetables and boats of lettuce. Because the som moo is fermented, it is meant to be eaten uncooked, similarly to pepperoni or salami.</p>
            
        <figure class="slideshow">

            <img class="mySlides" src="images/namkhao/namkhao1.jpeg" >
          <figcaption>If you are in New York City, Ashley suggests getting som moo and the kaffir lime leaves from<a href="https://g.co/kgs/K88kahb" target="_blank">Bangkok Center Grocery</a>in Manhattan's Chinatown.
          </figcaption>
         
          
          <script>
          var myIndex = 0;
          carousel();
          
          function carousel() {
            var i;
            var x = document.getElementsByClassName("mySlides");
            for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
              x[i].style.display = "none";  
            }
            myIndex++;
            if (myIndex > x.length) {myIndex = 1}    
            x[myIndex-1].style.display = "block";  
            setTimeout(carousel, 5000); // Change image every 2 seconds
          }
          </script>
      
      </figure>

        <p>With her parents owning a som moo production facility, Ashley grew up helping them package the key ingredient of Nam Khao, which she admits gave her an identity crisis as a kid. "People would ask me, 'What do your parents do?' How do I explain as a six- or seven-year-old what my parents are doing?" she said.</p>
            
        <p>Now, she embraces her parents' business as an essential part of who she is, sharing that som moo can be served simply with sticky rice or vegetables or as a staple ingredient in a variety of more complex dishes.</p>
            
        <p>Despite her childhood memories connected to Nam Khao, she has only made it once and acknowledges the time it takes to put it together. "I had taken so much time to really do everything from scratch," Ashley said. "This is where I'm like, 'Thank you so much, Mom. Thank you for cooking for me, because this shit was hard as hell.'"

        <p>Key ingredients like kaffir lime leaves can be tricky to find, but not impossible. Specialty Thai grocery stores often carry them, and if you're in Manhattan you can find them in Chinatown. Ashley's mom has also found one solution to this problem — once shipping the leaves fresh from their backyard tree in California all the way to New York, where her daughter was studying at the time.</p>
            
        <p>Looking ahead, Ashley sees embracing her culture and rediscovering culinary knowledge as a way to keep her future family rooted. "I need to have a good foundation in who I am in order for my kids to be able to have a good foundation in who they are," Ashley said.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">For the Cripsy Rice</span></li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>4 cups Jasmine rice, cooked</li>
        <li>Handful of kaffir lime leaves, thinly sliced (about 5-9 leaves depending on preference)</li>
        <li>Heavy spoonful of sugar</li>
        <li>Heavy handful of salt </li>
        <li>2-3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup grated or shredded coconut meat<li>
        <li>2-3 large spoonfuls of red curry paste</li>
        <li>2 spoonfuls of fish sauce</li>
        <li>5 cups of a stable oil (sunflower, soybean, canola, etc.)

        <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">For the Salad</span></li>
        <li>1-2 sticks of Nam Sausage "Som Moo"</li>
        <li>Cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>Scallions, chopped</li>
        <li>Unsalted Roasted Peanuts</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>Shallots, thinly sliced<li>
        <li>Fried Thai chilis (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 1:</span> Mix the egg, kaffir lime leaves, sugar, salt, garlic, red curry paste, coconut, and fish sauce into the rice while still warm. Use your hands or a large spatula to combine.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 2:</span> Form the mixture into small to medium sized balls.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 3:</span> After all the balls are formed, heat up the oil and deep fry all of your rice balls until golden brown. This should take 5-8 minutes.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 4:</span> Lay rice balls on a paper towel lined wire rack and let cool for 5-10 minutes.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 5:</span> Place the rice balls into a large bowl and begin breaking them down. Enough to have some smaller and larger pieces for a variety in texture. Cut up or shred the som moo into the bowl. Add in cilantro, scallions, and shallots.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 6:</span> Squeeze a generous amount of lime and top the dish with peanuts, and (optionally) fried thai chilis.</p>

    
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul class="recipenotes">
    <li><b>*</b>Nam Khao is typically served and eaten as an appetizer with a side of fresh veggies such as lettuce, mint, and more cilantro.</li>
    <li><b>*</b>The amount of curry paste used will determine the color of your dish. It is also high in sodium, so this can be adjusted to taste.</li>
    <li><b>*</b>The size of your rice balls isn't important, but it does determine how long each one will need to fry for.</li>
</ul>
