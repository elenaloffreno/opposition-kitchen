        <p>Between the two bordering countries with overlapping cultures, Lao's cuisine could best be described as Thai food's bolder cousin — spicier, herbaceous, and much less sweet.
        </p>

        <p>However, if you find yourself amongst New York City's<a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/files/reports/osdc/pdf/nyc-restaurant-industry-final.pdf">estimated 23,650 restaurants,</a> good luck finding a Lao restaurant. As of March 2025, there are none. Rather, you can catch glimpses of Laos hidden on some Thai menus, or might be able to request your order "Lao-style."
        </p>

        <p>There's a reason why Lao food isn't more visible; Thai food's dominance throughout the city didn't occur accidentally. In 2002 Thailand's government launched a<a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/why-are-there-so-many-thai-restaurants-7104115#:~:text=In%202002%2C%20the%20Thai%20government,wanted%20to%20open%20restaurants%20abroad.">gastro-diplomatic initiative</a>to globalize the country's culinary offerings, going so far as to sponsor its citizens to open Thai restaurants abroad.</p>

        <p>For 23-year-old Ashley Sayarath, whose parents own a "som moo" production facility in California, Lao food has always been close. A popular Lao ingredient, som moo is a fermented pork sausage that can be served simply with sticky rice or vegetables, or as a staple ingredient in a variety of more complex dishes. Because the som moo is fermented, it is meant to be eaten uncooked, similarly to salami.</p>

        <blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>Thank you so much, Mom. Thank you for cooking for me, because this shit was hard as hell.</p></blockquote>
            
        <p>Growing up Lao in Los Angeles meant navigating a constant cultural push-and-pull. Despite Southern California's large Asian population, Ashley's neighborhood was predominantly Hispanic and Black, giving her limited exposure to Asian culture beyond her mother's cooking.</p>

        <p>"As I was growing up and my mom was making these Lao dishes, it was really hard for me to just be like, 'Okay, I'm just going to eat it,'" Ashley said. "I was like, 'Girl, what's happening here?'"</p>

        <p>It wasn't until moving to New York as an adult that Ashley began to appreciate her Lao background — especially through food."When people would ask me things about myself, I really couldn't answer to the fullest potential. So I was basically relearning my heritage and relearning these cuisines," she said.</p>

        <p>One dish that Ashley recommends as an introduction to Lao food is "nam khao", and shares that the crispy rice salad is a great way to become acquainted with the basic flavors and textures of Lao cuisine. The dish combines deep-fried rice balls with som moo, fresh herbs, lime, fish sauce, and chili, eaten with fresh vegetables and boats of lettuce.</p>

        <p>Despite her fondness for nam khao, Ashley has only made it once and acknowledges the time it takes to put it together. "I had taken so much time to really do everything from scratch," Ashley said. "This is where I'm like, 'Thank you so much, Mom. Thank you for cooking for me, because this shit was hard as hell.'"</p>

          <figcaption>If you are in New York City, Ashley suggests getting som moo and the kaffir lime leaves from<a href="https://g.co/kgs/K88kahb" target="_blank">Bangkok Center Grocery</a>in Manhattan's Chinatown.

          var myIndex = 0;
          carousel();
          
          function carousel() {
            var i;
            var x = document.getElementsByClassName("mySlides");
            for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
              x[i].style.display = "none";  
            }
            myIndex++;
            if (myIndex > x.length) {myIndex = 1}    
            x[myIndex-1].style.display = "block";  
            setTimeout(carousel, 5000); // Change image every 2 seconds
          }
          </script>

        <p>Key ingredients like kaffir lime leaves can be tricky to find, but not impossible, as specialty Thai grocery stores often carry them. If you know someone with a kaffir lime tree? Ashley's mom has found one solution to this problem, once shipping the leaves fresh from their backyard tree in California all the way to New York, where her daughter was studying at the time. The best way to ship the leaves is by using expedited shipping options, to ensure they arrive quickly.</p>

        <p>Though she once felt uncertain about her parent's business, Ashley now embraces it as an essential part of who she is. "In the past few years, I've rediscovered what it means to be Lao," she said. "Food is universal — it ties everything together."</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">For the Cripsy Rice</span></li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>4 cups jasmine rice, cooked</li>
        <li>Handful of kaffir lime leaves, thinly sliced (about 5-9 leaves depending on preference)</li>
        <li>Heavy tbsp of sugar</li>
        <li>Heavy tbsp of salt </li>
        <li>2-3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup grated or shredded coconut meat<li>
        <li>2-3 tbsps of red curry paste</li>
        <li>2 tbsps of thai fish sauce</li>
        <li>5 cups of a stable oil (sunflower, soybean, canola, etc.)

        <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">For the Salad, measurements to taste</span></li>
        <li>1-2 sticks of nam sausage "som moo"</li>
        <li>Cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>Scallions, chopped</li>
        <li>Unsalted roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>Shallots, thinly sliced<li>
        <li>Fried thai chilis (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 1:</span> Mix the egg, kaffir lime leaves, sugar, salt, garlic, red curry paste, coconut, and fish sauce into the rice while still warm. Use your hands or a large spatula to combine.</li>
         <li><b>*</b>The amount of curry paste used will determine the color of your dish. It is also high in sodium, so this can be adjusted to taste.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 2:</span> Form the mixture into balls, roughly the size of a golf ball.</li><li><b>*</b> The size of your rice balls isn't important, but it does determine how long each one will need to fry for.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 3:</span> After all the balls are formed, heat up the oil and deep fry all of your rice balls until golden brown. This should take 5-8 minutes.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 4:</span> Lay rice balls on a paper towel lined wire rack and let cool for 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 5:</span> Place the rice balls into a large bowl and begin breaking them down. Enough to have some smaller and larger pieces for a variety in texture. Cut up or shred the som moo into the bowl. Add in cilantro, scallions, and shallots.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 6:</span> Squeeze a generous amount of lime and top the dish with peanuts, and (optionally) fried thai chilis.</li>
        <li><b>*</b>Nam Khao is typically served and eaten as an appetizer with a side of fresh veggies such as lettuce, mint, and more cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
