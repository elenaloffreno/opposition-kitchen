        <p><i>Editor's note:</i> One of my earliest memories of being transported elsewhere through unfamiliar food was in eighth grade. Our class had a social studies assignment I can only vaguely recall, and my friend Olivia brought in Spam musubi. The sweet mystery meat atop the soft, pressed rectangle of rice held together by the umami nori (a flavor profile I had yet to learn the vocabulary for) has had a visceral impact on my relationship with trying new foods.</p>

        <p>When asked to describe her favorite Hawaiian dish, loco moco, Olivia Hurley doesn't just talk about making it. She explains it's "good food for the belly, good food for the soul. It fills you up and makes you happy."</p>

        <p>A comfort food she associates with her grandma, it's also a throughline connecting Olivia back to Hawaii and even further to roots in Okinawa.</p>

        <p>Now living in Minnesota, where she works for a nonprofit consulting firm focused on rural affordable housing, Olivia grew up in Staten Island, New York, in a family that exemplifies the American melting pot: Japanese, Okinawan, Irish and Sicilian heritages.</p>

        <p>Loco moco was one of only a few meals her maternal grandma, Shirley Ikefugi, regularly prepared for Olivia and her older brother Justin Hurley, who were picky eaters as chilren.</p>

        <p>"We'd eat, and then we'd go take a little nap on the rug. And we would stuff our bellies again, and then pass out again. I feel like that was just the cycle," Olivia said. "The universal grandparent experience: get fat and go to bed."</p>

        <p>During Olivia's freshman year of college, loco moco was also the first recipe of Shirley's that she had learned to make, once her grandma started getting too old to cook anymore.</p>

        <p>The recipe reflects an intuitive cooking style, with her grandma's verbal instructions written in Olivia's Notes app. "It's very much a 'cook with your eyes' kind of thing," Olivia said.</p>

        <p>Loco moco consists of a few foundational components: a well-seasoned hamburger patty served over rice and topped with gravy. </p>

        <p>The gravy in her grandma's recipe comes from hamburger juices, beef stock and flour, becoming a vessel in which the patties marinate and simmer — normally for two hours, although Olivia admits that's a luxury not everyone has time for. Some variations include mushrooms and onions, though Olivia's grandma sticks to a simpler presentation.</p>

        <p>Growing up in what Olivia describes as a "very American" family with diverse heritages, food became one of the most accessible ways to connect with her ancestors. "Food feels like one of those basic things where it has allowed me to connect more with the cultures," she said.</p>

        <p>In a candid recollection about her "Americanized version" of Japanese, Okinawan and Hawaiian cultures, Olivia shares knowledge of her grandma's background: First-generation Hawaiian by nationality, she was born in 1935, when the state was still a U.S. territory. She eventually followed one of her sisters to New York City at 21, which Olivia considers the turning point in which her family began to really assimilate into American culture "to the point of rejecting being Japanese entirely."</p>

        <p>"We're a lot more Hawaiian than we are Japanese," Olivia said in reflection of her family's cultural identity. "Once I went to California [for college], I was like, 'we really don't know a lot of Japanese stuff.'"</p>

        <p>Yet certain cultural traits remained — what she views as the Hawaiian mentality of being caring and positive alongside a Japanese tendency toward emotional reservation. Speaking about her elder relatives on her mom's side, "You can be like, 'What was this experience like for you?' And they'll be like, 'Oh it was nice,'" she said, noting the difficulty of getting older family members to open up about their younger lives.</p>

        <p>When asked why she chose loco moco from among her grandmother's recipes, Olivia didn't miss a beat: "This is my favorite. Honestly, loco moco is my number one favorite food. I love it. It's just so delicious," she said. "It's easy to make and it's really shareable, which I think is nice."</p>
