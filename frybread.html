        <h2>Navajo Nation:<br>Frybread</h2>

        <p>Traditional indigenous crops that have always been relevant to Navajo diets thanks to their symbiotic relationship and resistant nature are also known as the three sisters: corn, beans, and squash. Nurturing one another, almost like a family, the corn provides a structure for the beans to climb, the beans release nitrogen which helps fertilize the corn and squash, and the squash shades the soil which holds in moisture.</p>

        <p>However, during the mid- to late-1800s when the United States Government forcibly pushed native people westward, the resulting desert setting of many reservations led to a food drought.</p>
        
        <p>And so frybread was born.</p>

        <p>For Navajo multi-media artist<a href="https://parkergrace.co/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAab7DbRB8yR4fmSc1kPYQKi0QdVbNgXIZgYDHkZVLXLco8S2fV80SwGI5Pc_aem_oqrxBhaagszADhnWYQoqwg" target="_blank">Parker Puls</a>in particular, frybread has offered an accessible means of remaining in touch with her late grandmother as well her cultural roots.</p>

        <p>As explained by Parker, frybread has become synonymous among many tribes because of the similar situations they were put in during their displacement. Her tribe, located in the<a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/geography/four-corners-united-states.html" target="_blank">Four Corners region,</a>often goes through droughts, making it difficult to farm at times.
        </p>

        <p>“The only grocery stores they really have accessible to them [as of 2025] are Walmart, and you know, they typically don't have the best produce or the most healthy options for Native people to choose from. So it's become a huge problem within indigenous communities, developing different diseases related to what they eat, particularly diabetes, which my grandmother struggled with, and a lot of my other family members struggle with as well,” Parker said.</p>

        <p>Many members of the Indigenous community have contradicting feelings about frybread, as some associate it with the unhealthy eating habits linked to their displacement while others view it as a symbol of resilience in spite of their displacement.</p>

        <p>“Reservations were a way that the government was trying to suppress and corner us into one area and reduce our numbers, not only through lack of basic needs like proper food supply, but also proper medication, hospitals, and other facilities. There's areas on my reservation that have no power, and it's 2025 — and that's by design — unfortunately,” Parker said. “We took something that was made out of necessity during these situations and have continued to survive and thrive off of that sort of food. It's a celebration of resilience in that sense.”</p>

        <p>Some of Parker's paternal family still live on the Navajo Reservation in Lukachukai, where the closest grocery store can be found about fourty minutes away in Chinle, Ariz.</p>

        <p>Thinking back to her time back at their home in California, where her grandmother moved after marrying, Parker recalls helping her out when she began to go blind. Her grandmother was a retired dietitian who loved to cook, and at five years old Parker became her second set of eyes in the kitchen.</p>

        <p>“She would make that stew all day, and then we would make frybread to go with it. We would all sit around her kitchen table, then we'd all make frybread together,” Parker said. “Usually we'd make it for big parties or sometimes she would cater events because everyone knew my grandmother's frybread was so good.”</p>

        <p>While frybread is made up of simple ingredients, the technique behind making it has a lot to do with feeling and temperature. Regarding the best spot to let the dough set, Parker shared that her grandmother used to set it in a warm corner by the clothes dryer.</p>

        <p>Despite losing her grandmother at 11 years old, Parker continues to connect with her on a spiritual level through sharing her recipes, like making it at her in-laws' house.</p>

        <p>During her time living in New York City she has also discovered different variations of frybread through friends from different tribes around the country. For example, one of her friends who is Paiute makes it thicker and smaller and another friend who is Sioux and from Minnesota just buys pizza dough from the store.</p>

        <p>“I'm biased. I think Navajo frybread's the best,” Parker said.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Crisco, plus some for frying</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 1: </span>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl.</li>

    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 3: </span>Add warm to hot water, enough to make the mixture completely wet. Mix the dough with your hands until it feels loose. </li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 4: </span>Cover with a dish towel or cloth and let sit for an hour.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 5: </span>When the dough is done setting, melt Crisco to fill a frying pan two to three inches deep.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 6: </span>While waiting for the pan to get hot, shape the dough to form a tortilla or plate shape. Poke a hole in the middle.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 7: </span>Fry the disc shaped dough until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul class="recipenotes">
    <li><b>*</b> When adding in the hot water, add more than you think you'll need. You may need to add more flour if the mixture gets too loose.</li>
    <li><b>*</b> One common way to enjoy Frybread at home is to use it as the tortillas for tacos — this is also refered to as "Indian Tacos."</li>
    </ul>
