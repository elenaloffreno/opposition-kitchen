        <p>From the restaurant chip basket to the fast-food packet, that familiar combination of heat and acidity serves as many Americans' most consistent point of contact with Mexican cuisine. Yet in spite of its ubiquity, salsa isn't just a condiment — it's a cultural testimonial, with countless variations to make and ways to serve.</p>

        <p>For 24-year-old <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maximasgomez/?hl=en" target="_blank">Maximas Gomez,</a>a Los Angeles native and home cook, salsa represents concrete proof that home exists wherever you have the knowledge to recreate it.
        
        <p>"Every Mexican family makes salsa. Everybody does it a little differently. But everybody knows how to make salsa," he said. "And that is one of the few things where it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman, the one thing you should know how to cook is a salsa."</p>

        <p>Growing up in Downtown LA, Maximas witnessed firsthand how food access shapes communities, but it was only after leaving for extended periods that the patterns became clear to him.</p>

        <p>"It's actually kind of crazy if you look on Google or Apple maps for 'Trader Joe's' or 'Whole Foods' and see all of the locations in the greater Los Angeles area, they essentially outline the food desert," he said. "It's clearly visible where these places are not."<p>

        <p>According to the<a hred="https://www.lafoodbank.org/about/hunger-in-l-a/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Regional Food Bank,</a>LA is home to one of the largest populations of any county in the nation, and it is estimated that one in four of the county's residents face food insecurity.<p>

        <p>Food deserts are defined as areas where access to affordable and nutritious food is limited or non-existent, particularly for those without reliable transportation. These areas are often located in urban neighborhoods and rural towns, which lack supermarkets in favor of convenience stores and fast food restaurants that offer options with minimal nutritional value.</p>
    


<p>Maximas also points out the important demographic reality that shapes the Mexican food landscape across American cities, as his awareness of regional diversity intensified during his move to New York for college.<p>
<p>"Most of the Mexican population in New York is from Puebla, which is a southern state. It's southern Mexican cooking, it's completely different. The flavor profiles are completely different," he said.</p>

<p>When it comes to the misconception that "New York doesn't have good Mexican food," Maximas offers a thoughtful perspective.</p>
<p>"That's just coming from people who hear that and then just like to regurgitate things," he said. "Mexico is a huge country with so many different cultures and subsets of ethnic groups. There's Afro-Mexican, there's indigenous populations that vary vastly. There's such a huge range of climate and geographical features: rainforests, mountains, deciduous forests, deserts."</p>

<p>The recipe Maximas shares comes from his late grandpa, who immigrated to the United States from Zacatecas, Mexico in the 1970s. Despite working multiple jobs to support ten children, his grandpa maintained this one culinary through-line over the years.</p>
<p>What makes this recipe particularly special is that while Maximas's grandma was the family's cook, her recipes were never documented before her premature passing from cancer.</p>
<p>"That was one of the biggest regrets of my mom's side of my family," Maximas said. "It's like we never had the forethought to write down grandma's cooking."</p>
<p>Following his grandma's passing, visits to his grandpa began to offer him a simple, consistent scene of comfort — what Maximas describes as "the quintessential Mexican meal" — beans,<a href="https://breadtopia.com/how-to-nixtamalize-corn-for-tortillas-tamales-posole-and-more/" target="_blank">nixtamalized corn,</a>and homemade salsa.</p>
<p>"He would always carry around a packet of his salsa in his pocket whenever we went out," Maximas said. "We would go out to an Italian restaurant, and he would pull out either a bag of chilis from his garden or a little packet of his homemade salsa in a Tupperware jar and put it on his spaghetti. And we're like, 'you're crazy.'"</p>
<p>This tradition of portable personal salsa isn't just a heart-warming piece of family lore — it's also representative of adaptation and cultural preservation in a new land.</p>
<p>Maximas has continued this practice in his own way, packing "a big gallon Ziploc bag of dried, roasted and then blitzed chilis" during his extensive international travels, to ensure he could recreate a taste of familiarity while abroad.</p>
<p>"It's so intertwined with tradition that I can be 3,000 miles away from Los Angeles and cook a recipe from home and instantly be transported," he said. "Or start my own traditions that mirror those of my family back home."</p>
<p>In a world of complexities, there's something beautiful about the simplicity of recipes like a good salsa. For Maximas? Salsa is the edible equivalent of a security blanket — providing both flavor and comfort, no matter how far from home he might be.</p>
<p>"I can go to sleep stress-free at night, knowing that I have some salsa in my fridge," he said.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ head Garlic, peeled (about 6 cloves)</li>
        <li>1½ lb tomatillos</li>
        <li>½ of a white onion, diced</li>
        <li>5 dried chiles de arbol *</li>
        <li>15 dried chile pulla seco *</li>
        <li>15 dried chile japon *</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li><b>*</b> A combination of about 20 guajillo and 10 arbol chiles will taste similar if chile pulla and chile japones cannot be found.</li>
        <li><b>*</b> Feel free to experiment with different chiles (fresh or dried) to make different types of salsas. Note that different chili peppers have different flavor and spiciness profiles. Arbol adds high heat and a light smokiness, pulla seco adds medium heat and a slight fruitiness, japones add medium heat with no overpowering distinct flavor, and guajillo chiles add a smoky fruit flavor, also with no significant heat.</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 1:</span> In a medium pot with enough water to cover, boil tomatillos for about 10 minutes until tender. You'll be able to stick a fork through them when ready. Save tomatillo water.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 2:</span> Destem dried chiles with scissors. Deseeding is optional. In a pan on medium heat, toast chilis for 3-4 minutes until they slightly darken and become aromatic. Move chiles around to avoid burning.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Step 3:</span> Add garlic, onion, chiles, tomatillos, and about 1 cup of reserved tomatillo water to a blender. Add salt to taste. Blend together and adjust seasoning if needed. Add additional water to thin out the salsa if it is too thick or chunky.
    </p>
    <p><b>*</b> If tomatillos are exceptionally sour or tart, add a pinch of sugar to the blend in order to cut through the acidity.</p>
