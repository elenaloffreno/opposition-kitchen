        <h2>Unpacking Frank Shyong's 'Lunch Box': Food and Travel Writing That Homes in on Substance Over Consumption</h2>

        <p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p>
    
        
        <p>After over a decade writing for the "Los Angeles Times", former <a href="https://www.latimes.com/people/frank-shyong" target="_blank">columnist</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/asianenoughpod/?hl=en" target="_blank">podcast host</a> Frank Shyong decided it was time to pack his own lunch box — filled to the brim with independent food for thought.</p>
        <p>At the heart of his journalistic practice, Shyong interrogates the world's existence at the crossroads of identity, community, institutional power and serving the public via the art of storytelling. As the first Asian American columnist to write for the LA Times, Shyong chronicled immigrant communities that traditional media often overlooked.</p>
        <p>More recently he has launched <a href="https://frankbear.substack.com/" target="_blank">Lunch Box</a>, a newsletter that reimagines food and travel journalism as something much more personal: less like a commercial product and more like a meal, carefully packed by someone who cares about the recipient.</p>


        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Can you tell me a bit about what you're currently up to in the realm of your work?</span></p>

        <p>I'm working on a number of pieces, some involving food and some not. The main food thing right now is researching the culture of bentos and ekibens in Japan, trying to look into the ways in which local marketing has helped to reverse gentrification and sort of urban renewal narratives in Japan. 
        </p>

        <blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>[...] Can travel writing have a purpose in  making it difficult to go to war with that country, and forging relationships with immigrants of that country in your own home?</p></blockquote>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Do you have any new or current goals for your newsletter?</p></span>

        <p>Right now, I'm essentially working on travel writing, but travel writing that I hope has a purpose in this day and age — travel writing with a mission statement. I'm thinking about guides, which are the way everyone is conditioned to consume information. But guides, as a form, leave a lot to be desired, because if it's the primary piece of journalism that we consume about places, all it does is sort of guide our consumption. It puts us in a consumptive mood with respect to other places.</p>

        <p>I've been wondering: What if the guide was also a guide to some of the intellectual transformations that you might be able to have while abroad? What if the guide also helped you understand the trade relationship that America has with the countries that you're visiting, especially since trade relationships are so in the news right now?</p>

        <p>One of the things I'm working on is looking at why Japan eats so much beef tongue. They created a whole culture of Japanese beef tongue restaurants, but the only reason everyone has to eat beef tongue is because of an unfavorable trade relationship with the United States that formed after World War II in which the United States essentially forced people to <a href="https://www.thebeefsite.com/articles/1965/the-history-of-u-s-beef-exports-to-japan" target=blank_>buy our beef and corn</a>.
            
        </p>
            
        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Why is it personally important for you to continue reporting on diverse places and cultures?</span></p>

        <p>For me, this started out as a passion project and then it directed me back towards the things that I'm concerned with and think are important — which are essentially production, protection, and nurturing of local culture.</p>
        <p>I think about: What do people need to know about the world? Is it what to buy? Is it what hotel to book? Can travel writing have a purpose in  making it difficult to go to war with that country, and forging relationships with immigrants of that country in your own home?</p>
      <p>What I like to do is start with something that people already like, something that they're already paying attention to. Then I take them somewhere that is useful for them to be, to lead that attention towards something that could help change the world for the better.</p>
        <p>I guess this comes from experiences of visiting places like Hawaii a lot. What I do when I go places is I always try to learn the story of the place and read about it. After a couple trips to Hawaii, the narrative tension between what you experience and what actually happens grows. People want help resolving that. People want help knowing the 'why' of everything.</p>


        <blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>For me, I try not to present myself as an expert. I try not to present myself as anything but what I am, and I allow other people to tell the story, to own the story.</p></blockquote>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">What's your approach to writing about cuisines or cultural practices that aren't your own? Has this evolved over time?</span></p>

        <p>At first I was wary of writing about cultures that weren't my own. It was because there was an environment of narrative scarcity in which a lot of times the culture that was being written about never got to actually write the articles. That meant that the articles themselves were lacking in a certain texture and flavor of experience that you would recognize if you're a member of that community.</p>
        <p>For me, I try not to present myself as an expert. I try not to present myself as anything but what I am, and I allow other people to tell the story, to own the story. That is a big part of it — if you're able to acknowledge a more humble purpose as a journalist, you're not there to be the smartest guy in the room and know everything. You're there to be the guy who listens the best and understands best.</p>
        <p>When I'm writing about another culture, I understand that there's going to be a lot written that that culture doesn't already agree with. You need to survey that material and put in far more legwork than someone would otherwise have to do.</p>
        <p>Right now, I'm reporting on aspects of Japanese culture, but I don't speak Japanese, so I'm at a huge disadvantage. The more I learn, the more I understand that I could never present myself as an expert in a culture that is so detailed. But what I can do is grow the knowledge base of what does exist in English, and if that's helpful to people. If I can write the most knowledgeable thing out there that exists in English, that will be a service.</p>
        <p>It's not like it's so rigid that you can only write about your own cultures. It's more like there's a lot of specific information, narratives, stories, and histories that you have to consume in order to gain a full picture — in order to write something that might gain muster with someone in that community — and you just have to adopt that as your standard.</p>
            
        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">It's been about five years since your podcast "Asian Enough" - has your thinking about identity evolved in your writing since then?</span></p>

        <p>That podcast came out during a time when there weren't that many, and now there are a lot. It was important that a mainstream podcast existed to clear some space for other conversations to also seem relevant. It's interesting they haven't really become one unified Asian podcast, but rather there's an Indian podcast, and others. That seems to serve people the most: When they have one that speaks to their individual identities in a more specific way and less in a broad way.</p>
        <p>That's the way I've come to think more of identity. Less about "Hey, what is it that all Asians have in common and what is our shared identity?" And instead, just embracing the fact that it is a lot of separate identities that are smushed together. They have connections — plenty of historical connections, connections in the home country, connections in experience, in the way we're treated here — but to search for that community and that sense of belonging, I think it makes more sense to look for that in more specific kinds of categories.</p>


        <blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>Food doesn't lie. We might lie about our political preferences on a political poll, but we don't lie about what we like to eat at the end of the day or what our favorite restaurant is.</p></blockquote>
            
        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Do you see food as a potential tool for cultural or political resistance? Should it be used that way?</span></p>

        <p>Food and food media is very commercialized, so trying to do resistance within food media doesn't seem to make a lot of sense because everyone's paycheck is tied to advertisers, tied to promotional opportunities.</p>
        <p>But food, if you study it from a historical perspective, from an anthropological perspective: Food is the primary way in which we express identity. We draw a lot of the borders of our identity based on what we eat, what we don't eat, what others eat and what we eat. Food doesn't lie. We might lie about our political preferences on a political poll, but we don't lie about what we like to eat at the end of the day or what our favorite restaurant is. So there is this lack of artifice that exists within food where you can speak to people and reach people in a very pure and direct way.</p>
        <p>Politically, our main challenge as a society has been to not starve — right? And how every nation that has solved the problem of hunger has deeply shaped them and who they are. So food is definitely a revealing lens. People's guards are down at the dinner table.</p>
        <p>The politics of food is really frustrating to me. A lot of the people who want to use their food or their cookbook to resist something — there's just a lot of talk about that in the food sphere. A lot of good-sounding talk.</p>
        <p>For me, profiting is different from looking at the economics of the publishing industry, and how all of the jobs and the prestige and the thing that allows the industry to exist are these food sections, food magazines, food publications. These food publications consider service journalism essentially teaching people where to spend their money. That's primarily the work product: guides.</p>
        <p>I think you should be able to profit off of your work, but I'm speaking more to the economics that allows the industry to exist. There's just a promotional aspect to a lot of restaurant content.</p>
            

        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">What's the most surprising insight you've gained throughout your career writing about everything from economics to underrepresented communities to travel?</span></p>

        <p>I guess I would say the more I know, the more I know that I don't know. The more knowledge you gain, the more knowledge you gain of your ignorance. So it's always been very important to continue learning to just maintain that humility when it comes to reporting.</p>
        <p>The market and a lot of economic incentives really drive reporting to seem very authoritative and factual, and sometimes we ask for a factual reality that is more certain than what exists. If we as journalists just convey that ambiguity to people, a lot of the times they feel like they haven't been served from a product perspective, because what they're looking for is cold, hard facts. But sometimes the truth is about the blurriness—it is about trying to blur the sharp and certain feelings that people have.</p>
