        <p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p>
    
        
        <p>Have you ever taken a bite of a fresh piece of fruit and wondered where it came from?</p>
        <p>At the root of his unique practice, multimedia artist <a href="https://chrissleiman.com/" target="_blank">Christian Sleiman</a> probes this enigma, unraveling a world that exists at the intersection of history, food, art and sociopolitics.</p>
        <p>Christian was born in Lebanon, where foraging was part of his daily life. He is now based in Amsterdam after various residencies across Europe and the Middle East, where his ongoing <a href="" target="_blank">"Supper Club"</a> series spans culinary performances, indie publications and exhibitions.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">What drew you to focus your artistic practice on food?</span></p>

        <p>I started doing projects on plants and on foraging culture. I grew up in a small village in Lebanon and we were foraging a lot — it's part of our diet, it's part of how we eat. I felt that I'd been missing this since I started university because I was living in the city during that period. 
        </p><p>
        So, I started researching foraging, and to share the research, I had to bring the ingredients, bring the plants. I had to cook sometimes because it's a way to activate it, a way to make the idea consumable. Through foraging, I realized that I'm actually interested in cooking, and then the history of food, politics of food. 
        </p><p>
        It made sense for me to use food as the medium because it has two objectives: One is to research the food that I'm eating. But at the same time, to share the information I just have to cook the food and share it in a small setup. So the food becomes both the object and the medium.</p>

        <blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>The food becomes a testimony of the changes or the forces that shaped it and why it's still here, why it's still accessible, or why it disappeared.</p></blockquote>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Does your architecture background influence how you approach food?</p></span>

        <p>I can see the link when I talk about the infrastructure — what it takes to get the food that we have. Architecture helped a lot because, towards the end of my studies, I was not focused on design, although the program was in design. I was more interested in urban planning: how a city is formed, who designed the city, what the criteria to design a city are. In that sense, I can see how I'm relating to food because it's a bigger structure than one entity. And it's most of the time imposed on us.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Was there a specific moment when you realized food would be central to your work?</span></p>
        <p>I made a deliberate decision at some point to pick the center of my work around something that I encounter every day, for me to keep the momentum and keep the interest. Food became my thing. I was like, 'I'm now living by myself. I need to take care of my dietary needs — what to eat, how to consume food.' It really started as a way for me to educate myself.</p>
            
        <p>I'm always researching stuff that relates to the mundane, the things that are around us that we were never taught. You study in school that you have a farmer and this farmer produces food and then you get the food. But then when you go to the supermarket, you realize that it's not the case at all. I wanted to know what I'm consuming today. I would eat hummus with a salad and think, 'Let me look how hummus came to be — who invented it, why it's here.' So then it opened up to different topics.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">How can food function as a form of cultural or political resistance?</span></p>
        <p>Our existence is political just by itself. Being from Palestine, Lebanon, Syria and trying to do art is political. Being from this region and saying, 'I'm going to try to think and create forms or take something that sometimes can be not tangible and give it a form and a shape' is already political.
        <p>The structure that the city works in goes against all natural things, all seasonal things. You go to the supermarket, you have tomatoes all the time, you have watermelon all the time. The click that I had was when I started seeing tabbouleh. Tabbouleh is seasonal — it used to be a summer salad because tomato and parsley are just growing in spring and summer. The fact that we now have access to it and can make it in winter was going against this idea of why this salad existed.</p>

        <p>Before the French mandate, Lebanon used to have goats as their main source of meat. But then the French started importing more cows, because cows were their source of meat and milk. So we shifted from using goats to using cows for our meat because cows are kind of cheaper — you're killing one animal and this animal can feed an entire village, whereas for goats, you need to kill so many. 
        </p><p>The food system shifted to cultivating cows, although cows don't exist naturally in Lebanon. We don't produce hay; our climate is not the most suitable for them. Till today, we still import cows, we still import hay. And this altered the way that we eat food. The food becomes a testimony of the changes or the forces that shaped it and why it's still here, why it's still accessible, or why it disappeared.</p>
       
        <blockquote class="pull-quote">
            <p>This idea of nourishing and poisoning ourselves is a thin line, and we're always walking on it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">What has been the most surprising discovery in your research?</span></p>
        <p>I was working on a publication about foraging culture, and when I started going with different people from the village to forage, they would point out different plants and tell me 'This is mallow, this is za'atar,' and share how you can use it. In my mind, I started wondering: If they're pointing out the things we can eat, but there are still plants in between them that they are not mentioning, then those must be poisonous. If they are not nourishing us, then they are killing us.</p>

        <p>I started looking into this concept of 'pharmacon'. Pharmacon is the etymology of pharmacy, a Greek word that means both poison and remedy. It's mainly how something is on this thin line between poisoning and nourishing or healing. At the heart of all the medications that we take are plants that, most of the time, are poisonous.
        </p><p>For dandelion, you have the leaves that you can eat, but once the stem starts to grow and you see a flower, the leaves become hard to eat. Once the flower is blooming, the leaves become poisonous.</p><p>I started seeing how nourishing ourselves and killing ourselves are sometimes the same gesture, sitting on this thin line. This idea of nourishing and poisoning ourselves is a thin line, and we're always walking on it.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">You often talk about having a rhizomatic approach to your work. What does that mean to you?</span></p>
        <p>It was hard for me to keep one interest, just because I'm interested in so many things. At some point I realized that it doesn't need to be linear. Most of the time we learn history in a very linear way, but linearity is not exactly the way that I experienced life.</p>
        <p>When I started researching about food, I was interested in the nutritional aspect of it, how it came to be, the political aspect of it, the recipes that we make. This rhizomatic approach makes it more wholesome because you're looking at it from different angles. It makes it more layered, richer, but also it grounds it in certain pillars.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">What do you hope people take away from your work?</span></p>
        <p>I hope they can take out anything that benefits them. I see my role as trying to look at different ideas, different things, and give them a form that can be more accessible or easily digestible. I'm trying as much as I can also to make the information that I gather free and accessible for people, because I think information should be accessible to all of us.</p>
        <p>If my work is generating one idea or giving them a new point of view, that's already something valuable. That's enough for me — that people can leave knowing that they learned something new or it triggered something in the way that they see the world or food, or changed a bit of their perspective.</p>


        <blockquote class="pull-quote"><p>
            When you share a meal with someone, you allow this vulnerable side of you to surface, to put it on the table and share it with the other person.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Tell us about your 'Supper Club' project.</span></p>
        <p>I don't think 'Supper Club' will ever stop. It started as a way for me to invite my friends and share with them my research. Then I realized that I would like my friends to invite their friends too, and to share it with as many people as possible. For it to be accessible, it needs to be accessible but also tangible to people.</p>
        <p>I think we need more gatherings; we need more created spaces where people can just meet around food. The topic can be anything, but just to meet together around food is already a good starting point for conversations to happen. The best moments and the most honest moments are around food or around the table.</p>
            
        <p>There is this text analyzing Emmanuel Kant's writing around food. Kant talks about how food always needs to be shared, that when you're eating with someone, this other person is allowing you to see them chew and eat, which brings a vulnerable side. When you share a meal with someone, you allow this vulnerable side of you to surface, to put it on the table and share it with the other person. I believe in this practice.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">How do you structure 'Supper Club' events?</span></p>
        <p>I don't want to hijack the entire event. I just want to create a setup and make an excuse for everyone to come, and food is the best excuse. At the beginning I share the research for 15 minutes, I share a small story, and then I serve the food. Most of the time I pick music that aligns with or has a link to the food that I'm serving. Then the rest of the night is just open for people to eat, share, discuss — and it doesn't need to even be about the topic I shared. I just want people to come together and discuss because this is where things can actually happen.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Is there anything of importance that you'd like to share that we haven't spoken about?</span></p>
        <p>[Gastronationalism]still exists in Lebanon, discussing the origin of ingredients and who made hummus or who made falafel. We kind of forget that those dishes pre-existed the countries that we know today. There was hummus, falafel—we were all the same country under the Ottoman Empire. It's literally less than 100 years since these countries took the shape that we know them now.</p>
        <p>This is just the idea of national identity that every nation wanted to gather people around a common ideology, common identity of what this country stands for. An easy way is to say this country is known for having access to the sea, it's known for its mountain, it's known for its four seasons, it's known for this dish, this ingredient, this tree. And then you're like, 'Okay, we did the branding. Let's move on.'</p>
        <p>It makes sense because if the land offers you chickpeas and you crush it, you have hummus. As simple as that. If the land that you are growing in has a lot of wheat, if you just pick it up, crush it, put it with water, you have flour; you have dough already.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;">What resources would you recommend for people interested food culture?</span></p>
        <p>
        <a href="https://michaelpollan.com/" target="_blank">Michael Pollan</a> was someone that helped me shape my practice. He's an American journalist who focused on food and different stories, history of food.</p>
        <p>There is another food historian,<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/45516.Massimo_Montanari" target="_blank"> Massimo Montanari, </a>who talks about the history of food from an anthropological perspective.</p>
        <p>If you don't have energy to read, at least read the packages of the food that you buy. When you look at the ingredients of ultra-processed food, you see that you don't know most of the ingredients. They are all chemical names that are a bit alienating when you're trying to buy bread or a biscuit and you flip it and see that it's made with all these bunch of random ingredients. That's already alarming. So reading what you're eating is a good starting point.</p>
