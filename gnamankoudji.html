        <p>Reminiscing on childhood memories of summer evenings in Pennsylvania,<a href="https://nadiamaureen.com/" target="_blank">Nadia O'Hara</a>pictures herself running home to wind down, only to find her mom sitting on their swinging bench, biting the edge off of a plastic bag and enjoying its gingery, mouth-watering frozen contents. Running inside, Nadia would find their fridge and freezer filled with homemade gnamankoudji.</p>

        <p>For years, gnamankoudji was something she connected solely to her mom — until, in 2013, when she traveled to the Ivory Coast, her mom's birthplace. There she saw it everywhere, typically presented in plastic water bottles with the labels torn off. In 2022 Nadia began making yearly trips to visit the southern coast of West Africa, with her longest stay being this past summer for an entire month.</p>

        <p>After unintentional weight loss, due to the stress of completing her undergraduate studies at Parsons School of Design, Nadia credits the food she ate on her most recent trip for getting her back in shape.</p>

        <p>“I love the food there. I didn't realize [I gained weight] because I was just eating three good meals a day, which is so crazy,” Nadia said.</p>

        <p>The Ivory Coast's food scene is just as engrossing as the country's history. Home to the largest Lebanese diaspora in West Africa as well as a small Vietnamese population, Nadia recommends getting the shawarma and spring rolls if you find yourself near the country's largest city, Abidjan.</p>
        
        <p>As for Ivorian staples, Nadia's favorites are alloco (fried plantains), fried fish (the only way she'll eat it), and slow-cooked meats that are barbecued or stewed. 
       
        <p>“They're main equivalent to rice or grain is called Attiéké, which is fermented cassava. But it looks like couscous. So it's couscous texture, but it's cassava. It's almost a little bit sour, but it's very, very good,” Nadia shared.</P>
        
        <p>Two beverages that Nadia has found impossible to miss out on throughout her time in the Ivory Coast — available everywhere, from street vendors to grocery stores — are gnamankoudji and bissap. Bissap can best be described as an iced hibiscus tea while gnamankoudji offers what Nadia describes as a “very rich” ginger tang with a refreshing kick.</p>

        <p>“They're the type of thing that if you were, for example, to go to a wedding or any kind of large group setting, it would be expected to have this drink [gnamankoudji] there. That's usually what people would ask for,” Nadia said.</p>

        <p>Because of the French colonial influence on the Ivory Coast, Nadia's maternal aunts both moved to France. One trip to Europe to visit her aunts lead to the eventual addition of pineapple juice in her mom's gnamankoudji recipe, five or so years ago — a tweak that Nadia argues makes it taste all the more delicious.</p>
        
        <p>Staying true to her first-gen American girl fashion, Nadia experiments with gnamankoudji as a mixer, citing her own champagne-mixed, mimosa-like creation. She also recommends mixing it with Bissap, although this is not done traditionally and might get you a few stares in the Ivory Coast.</p>

        <p>And while gnamankoudji is probably best experienced while immersed in Ivorian culture, it can just as easily be made and enjoyed in the comfort of your own home.</p>
